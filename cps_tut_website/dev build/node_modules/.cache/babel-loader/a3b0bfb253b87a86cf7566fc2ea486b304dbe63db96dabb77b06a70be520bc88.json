There is a key opportunity to be explored by demonstrating how the vehicle HIL bench can be expanded to simulate the use of the hardware components in real working scenarios by interfacing it with the virtual driving HIL bench’s simulation capabilities.\n                        </p>\n                    </Slide>\n                    <Slide right>\n                        <p>\n                            A combined use case will be demonstrated by showcasing a CAN bus attack scenario, this time utilizing both benches in order to obtain more output and data. The virtual driving HIL bench is configured in a client-server architecture, allowing multiple clients to act as distinct simulation vehicles in the same simulation environment which is hosted on a server. The server will use means of cloud communication to initiate an event and invoke commands to pass attack messages to the real-world CAN bus subsystems in the vehicle HIL bench. This will be replacing the virtual CAN found in the simulation vehicle, showing how real vehicle hardware can be interfaced with the simulation environment.\n                        </p>\n                    </Slide>\n                    <Slide right>\n                        <p>\n                            After passing the attack messages to the vehicle HIL bench, the CAN bus subsystems will send back reply messages to the cloud communication infrastructure, which will be relayed back to the virtual driving bench's client. The client will provide a concrete visual representation of the effects of the CAN attack by showing the simulation vehicle lose control and possibly experience a collision.\n                        </p>\n                    </Slide>\n                    <Slide right>\n                        <p>\n                            These impacts of such an attack would not be able to be replicated using the vehicle HIL bench exclusively. The type of datasets that may be collected from the vehicle simulation and the HIL bench in conjunction will be unique and have never been seen before in the open-source road vehicle development space.\n                        </p>\n                    </Slide>\n\n                </ParallaxLayer>\n\n            </Parallax>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default TutorialFormat;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,SAASC,QAAQ,EAAEC,aAAa,QAAQ,wBAAwB;AAChE,SAASC,UAAU,QAAQ,+BAA+B;AAC1D,OAAO,uCAAuC;AAC9C,SAASC,KAAK,QAAQ,cAAc;AAAC;AAErC,SAASC,cAAc,GAAE;EACrB,oBACI;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;IAAA,uBAC3B,QAAC,QAAQ;MAAC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAI;MAAC,KAAK,EAAE;QAACC,eAAe,EAAEH,UAAU,CAACI;MAAK,CAAE;MAAA,uBAE7D,QAAC,aAAa;QACV,KAAK,EAAE,CAAE;QAAA,wBAGT,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,wBACR;YAAA,8CAAsB;cAAM,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAe;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eACtE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACf,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eAER,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,wBACR;YAAA,8CAAsB;cAAM,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAY;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eACnE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACf,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eAER,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,wBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAqB,eACrB;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACf,eAER,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,wBACR;YAAA,sDAA8B;cAAM,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAe;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC9E;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACf,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eAER,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,wBACR;YAAA,sDAA8B;cAAM,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAAY;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC3E;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACf,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eAER,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,wBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAA6C,eAC7C;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAmB;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACf,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA,eACR,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,KAAK;UAAA,uBACR;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAEI;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IAEI;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAET;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACT;AAEd;AAAC,KA9FQF,cAAc;AAgGvB,eAAeA,cAAc;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
